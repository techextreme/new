<h1 align="center" style="font-size:20px; font-style:bold">PAKISTAN MOVMENT</h1>
<p id="text">Eminent ulemas and spiritual leaders such as, Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Maulana Abdul Hamid Badayuni, Dewan Syed Ale Rasul Ali Khan of Ajmer, Pir Ladlay Hussain of Gulharga, Khwaja Ghulam Sadeed-ud-din of Tonsa, Sajjada Nasheen of Pakpattan, Syed Ghulam Mohiuddin Chisti of Golra, Maulana Qamar-ud-din of Saeeyal, Pir Syed Jamiat Ali Shah of Alipore, Maulana Syed Fazal Shah of Jalalpur and many more participated in the election campaign. The spiritual leaders directed their followers to only vote for the Muslim League candidates. The Fatawas issued by the ulemas and messages propagated by the spiritual heads created a deep impression that Pakistan enjoyed the blessing of the God Almighty. It goes without saying that without the support of the religious leaders it was nearly impossible for the League to secure cent percent votes in the election of Central Legislative Assembly, which decisively produced favourable results in the Provincial Assembly elections subsequently held in 1946. The contribution of ulemas for the creation of Pakistan must be realised as a most significant factor to be remain a living force in the contemporary history of Pakistan.

<p id="text">When he completed his rationale studies, he started thinking about completing Hadith Sharif. Two teachers were under consideration; this honour should get from Hazrat Maulana Amjad Ali Sahib or from Maulana Syed Muhammad Naeem-ud-Din Murad Abadi (RA). He went to Siyal Sharif Sheikh-ul-Islam Hazrat Khawaja Muhammad Qammar-ud-Din Siyalvi (RA) ordered for Murad Abadi Sharif. So he went to Maulana Syed Muhammad Naeem-ud-Din Murad Abadi (RA) in 1942. During these days Pakistan Movement was on its peak. Hazrat Sadr-ul-Afazil Maulana Syed Muhammad Naeem-ud- Din Murad Abadi (RA) was so busy person but he expressed his extreme affection. Bukhari Sharif completely and few other books he educated himself. He educated fundamental educations about Mysticism and Islam’s social and moral system Remaining portion of Hadith Sharif and lessons of other books he responded to Hazrat Maulana Muhammad Omar Sahib, and respected father Maulana Ather Naeemi Sahib. Both the two teachers treated so gently and affectingly. Hazoor confirmed that he got information about various segments of life in presence of Maulana Syed Muhammad Naeem-ud-Din Murad Abadi (RA). Relationship between teacher and student I just acquired awareness about it from the said teacher’s presence. The respected teacher whenever got weary, he used to have massage of Almonds oil on his head. Hazoor stated that during my stay in Murad Abad Sharif often he got that honour. He completed his Hadith Sharif in 1943. Hazrat dewan Syed aley Rasool Ali Khan Ajmeri R,A (sajjada nashin dargah ajmer sharif) awarded the diploma. While awarding this diploama Maulana Syed Muhammad Naeem-ud-Din Murad Abadi (RA) affirmed “ I am satisfied that I was trusty of spiritual sciences and Hadith Sharif. That trust I entrusted to suitable individual.”

<h1 align="center" style="font-size:20px; font-style:bold">COMMENTS ON KHATAM E NABUWAT</h1>
<p id="text">No enemies of Islam and the Qadiyanies can prove from any verse of the Qur’an that there would be any prophet after the Last Prophet Muhammad (SALLALLAHO–ALEHHI–WASSALLAM). Such a faith denies God’s words in the Qur’an that: (Today We have completed Our Religion for you….)
The Last Guidance from God had been revealed to Muhammad (SALLALLAHO–ALEHHI–WASSALLAM) and Muhammad (SALLALLAHO–ALEHHI–WASSALLAM) is the last prophet of God. So whoever says or does anything contrary to this, whether he is a Qadiyani or not, are an infidel and an apostate.

<p id="text">Who is entitled to succeed to the office of Sajadanashin? And what is the right of Durgah Committee in the matter? The dispute relating to the office of Sajadanashin started in 1947, when the last office holder-Syed Ali Rasool Khan migrated to Pakistan. Consequently, the need to appoint a new Sajadanashin arose. On April 5, 1948, the Chief Commissioner of Ajmer appointed Hakim Inayat Hussain as Sajadanashin. That appointment was challenged by a person called Syed Ilamuddin. He claimed that the succession to the office of Sajadanashin is governed by the rule of primogeniture. He was the rightful person entitled to hold the office. Hakim Inayat Hussain had no such right or title.

<p id="text">The spiritual head and (ii) Mutwalli-the secular head. The hereditary descendants of the Saint often laid claim to these two offices. The disputes as to the latter was taken even upto the Privy Council. In Asrar Ahmed v. Durgah Committee, A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 1 the Privy Council said that the office of Mutwalli was not hereditary. We are not concerned with the office of Mutwalli. We are concerned with two questions relating to the spiritual head of the Shrine. Who is entitled to succeed to the office of Sajadanashin? And what is the right of Durgah Committee in the matter? The dispute relating to the office of Sajadanashin started in 1947, when the last office holder-Syed Ali Rasool Khan migrated to Pakistan.
